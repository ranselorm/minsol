            It is part of our history, and from the beginning, it has been part
            of the essence of our work. Thus, we strive to highlight this
            approach and to be recognized as a strategic partner that adds value
            to mining processes and other target markets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-grey mb-4">
            In order to achieve this, we listen to our key stakeholders:
            collaborators, suppliers, partners, clients, community, and
            shareholdersâ€”looking to co-create, and deliver comprehensive
            solutions that respond to the needs of the sectors we serve,
            minimizing the negative impacts that our business generates,
            increasing the positive ones, and always creating value.
          </p>
          <p className="text-grey mb-4">
            Based on this premise, our Sustainability Strategy is built on four
            pillars that aim to anticipate the environmental challenge in all
            the areas where we are present. These are:
